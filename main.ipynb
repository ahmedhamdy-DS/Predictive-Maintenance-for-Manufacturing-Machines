    "**Insights:**  \n",
    "- **XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting, CatBoost** are the top-performing models.  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression performs the worst on **F1 and AUC**, likely due to the **class imbalance**.  \n",
    "- Ensemble methods (boosting) consistently outperform bagging methods (RandomForest, ExtraTrees) on AUC.\n",

    "### **2️⃣ ROC-AUC Curves**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **ROC-AUC curve** visualizes the trade-off between **True Positive Rate** and **False Positive Rate** for each model.  \n",
    "- All top models achieve **AUC > 0.97**, indicating **excellent discrimination** between failures and normal cases.  \n",
    "- The diagonal line represents **random chance (AUC = 0.5)** for comparison.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Performance Metrics Comparison (Bar Charts)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bar charts provide a **visual comparison** of all models across **F1, Recall, and Precision**.  \n",
    "- Enables a quick identification of **high-precision vs high-recall models**, depending on business priorities:  \n",
    "  - For predictive maintenance, **Recall** might be prioritized to **catch as many failures as possible**, even at the cost of some false positives.  \n",
    "  - Precision is also important to **avoid unnecessary interventions**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Business Value:**  \n",
    "- These results guide **model selection** for deployment in predictive maintenance.  \n",
    "- Top models can be further tuned or used in **ensemble strategies** to maximize reliability.  \n",
    "- Visualizations (ROC + Bar Charts) provide **intuitive insights for stakeholders** beyond numeric metrics.\n"
